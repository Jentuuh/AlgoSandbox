# Algo Sandbox
This is my first React project. I'm making this because I like algorithms, although I can approve that sometimes it can be hard to visualize them, and I think visualizing them makes it much easier to learn and understand the correctness of an algorithm. I'm starting off with path-finding algorithms, once that's finished with base functionality I'll probably add other algorithms as well.

As I said before, I'm a beginner to React and trying to absorp as much information as I can at the moment, so if there's anything that I can improve, feel free to point it out to me!
